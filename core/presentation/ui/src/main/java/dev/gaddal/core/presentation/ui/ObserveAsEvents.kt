 * the [Lifecycle] is in the STARTED state. This ensures events are collected only when the UI is active.
 *
 * @param flow The [Flow] emitting events to be observed.
 * @param key1 An optional key used to control recomposition.
 * @param key2 An optional key used to control recomposition.
 * @param onEvent A callback function invoked with each event emitted from the [flow].
